# hello-world

Probably not suppose to be here but glad I am!

Camarr83 here, I'm a T&O Consultant out of the Dallas office looking to build new skills and bridge the gap between Delivery, Functional, and T&O workstreams on my current and future projects to deliver the best value to our clinets.

Interesting personal facts: I used to fly Apache helicopters in the Army, co-wrote an Amazon Bestselling Book in Military Policy, co-founded a Non-Profit to help Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury, and have appeared on FoxNews & CNN.

Be Love!
